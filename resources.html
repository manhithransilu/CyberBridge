                            <dd>
                                The process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. This typically
                                involves something you know (password), something you have (phone), or something you are
                                (biometrics).

                            <dd>
                                A network of compromised computers (called "bots" or "zombies") controlled by an
                                attacker. Botnets are used for distributed denial-of-service attacks, spam distribution,
                                and credential theft.
                            </dd>

                            <dd>
                                A method of cracking passwords by systematically trying every possible combination until
                                the correct one is found. Strong passwords and account lockouts help prevent these
                                attacks.
                            </dd>

                            <dd>
                                An incident where sensitive, protected, or confidential data is copied, transmitted,
                                viewed, stolen, or used by an unauthorised individual. Breaches can expose personal
                                information, passwords, and financial details.
                            </dd>

                            <dt>Encryption</dt>
                            <dd>
                                The process of converting information into a code to prevent unauthorised access.
                                Encrypted data can only be read by someone with the correct decryption key. HTTPS uses
                                encryption to secure web traffic.
                            </dd>

                            <dd>
                                A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network
                                traffic based on predetermined security rules. Acts as a barrier between trusted and
                                untrusted networks.

                            <dd>
                                Malicious software or hardware that records keystrokes on a device. Used to capture
                                passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information as users type.
                            </dd>

                            <dd>
                                Short for "malicious software" — any software intentionally designed to cause damage to
                                a computer, server, client, or network. Includes viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware,
                                and spyware.
                            </dd>

                            <dd>
                                A security process that requires more than one form of verification to access an
                                account. Typically combines something you know (password) with something you have
                                (phone) or something you are (fingerprint). Also called Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
                            </dd>

                            <dt>Phishing</dt>
                            <dd>
                                A type of social engineering attack where attackers impersonate trusted entities to
                                trick victims into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials, credit
                                card numbers, or personal data. Commonly delivered via email.
                            </dd>

                            <dt>Ransomware</dt>
                            <dd>
                                A type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment (usually in
                                cryptocurrency) for the decryption key. Can render computers and networks completely
                                unusable.
                            </dd>

                            <dt>Social Engineering</dt>
                            <dd>
                                Psychological manipulation techniques used to trick people into making security mistakes
                                or giving away sensitive information. Exploits human psychology rather than technical
                                vulnerabilities.
                            </dd>

                            <dt>Spyware</dt>
                            <dd>
                                Software that secretly gathers information about a person or organisation and sends it
                                to another party without consent. Can monitor browsing habits, capture keystrokes, and
                                steal personal data.
                            </dd>

                            <dt>Trojan Horse</dt>
                            <dd>
                                Malware disguised as legitimate software. Unlike viruses, trojans don't replicate
                                themselves but create a backdoor for attackers to access your system. Often distributed
                                through email attachments or fake downloads.
                            </dd>

                            <dt>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</dt>
                            <dd>
                                See Multi-Factor Authentication. A specific type of MFA that requires exactly two forms
                                of verification—typically a password and a code sent to your phone.
                            </dd>

                            <dt>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</dt>
                            <dd>
                                A service that creates an encrypted connection between your device and a server,
                                protecting your internet traffic from interception. Essential when using public Wi-Fi
                                networks.

                                A type of malware that attaches itself to legitimate programs and spreads when those
                                programs are shared. Unlike worms, viruses require human action (like opening a file) to
                                spread.

                                Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks without human intervention. Worms
                                can consume bandwidth, delete files, or install backdoors for future access.

                                A software security flaw unknown to the vendor or developer, with no available patch.
                                Called "zero-day" because developers have had zero days to fix the issue before it's
                                exploited.
