                    <h2>The "Core 4" Protective Habits</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the complex world of cybersecurity, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of
                        threats and protective measures. That's why we've distilled essential security practices into
                        the <strong>"Core 4"</strong> — four fundamental habits that, when practiced consistently,
                        dramatically reduce your risk of falling victim to cyber attacks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These habits are designed specifically for university students who may be managing multiple
                        accounts, using various devices, and accessing sensitive academic resources. Master these four
                        practices, and you'll have a solid foundation for your digital security.
                    </p>
                </article>

                        <!-- HABIT 1 -->
                        <article class="habit" id="habit1">
                            <h3>Strong Passphrases</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Weak passwords are the leading cause of account
                                compromises. Attackers use automated tools that can crack simple passwords in seconds,
                                but strong passphrases can take centuries to break.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What to do:</strong> Instead of using complex passwords with random symbols
                                (which are hard to remember), use passphrases — long phrases made of random words. For
                                example, "correct-horse-battery-staple" is both memorable and extremely secure.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Practical Tips:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Length over complexity:</strong> A 20-character passphrase with common words
                                    is stronger than an 8-character password with symbols
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Use a password manager:</strong> Tools like Bitwarden (free), 1Password, or
                                    LastPass can generate and store unique passphrases for every account
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Never reuse passwords:</strong> If one account is breached, all accounts
                                    with the same password become vulnerable
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Change passwords if compromised:</strong> Use

                                        Have I Been Pwned</a

                                    to check if your email has appeared in data breaches
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                <strong>Student Tip:</strong> Your university account password should be unique and

                            <h3>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Even the strongest password can be stolen through
                                phishing or data breaches. MFA adds an additional verification step, so even if an
                                attacker has your password, they still can't access your account without the second
                                factor.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What to do:</strong> Enable MFA on every account that offers it, especially
                                email, banking, social media, and your university accounts. Most services now offer this
                                feature in their security settings.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Types of MFA (from most to least secure):</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Hardware security keys:</strong> Physical devices like YubiKey — most secure
                                    but requires purchasing a device
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Authenticator apps:</strong> Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator,
                                    or Authy — generate time-based codes
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Push notifications:</strong> Approve logins from your phone — convenient and
                                    reasonably secure
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>SMS codes:</strong> Better than nothing, but vulnerable to SIM swapping
                                    attacks — use other methods when available
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>How to Enable MFA:</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Go to your account's security or privacy settings</li>
                                <li>Look for "Two-Factor Authentication" or "Two-Step Verification"</li>
                                <li>Choose your preferred method and follow the setup instructions</li>
                                <li>Save your backup codes in a secure location</li>
                            </ol>
                            <div class="alert alert--warning">
                                <strong>Important:</strong> Always save your MFA backup codes! If you lose access to
                                your phone, these codes are your only way back into your accounts.

                            <h3>Phishing Recognition</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Phishing attacks trick you into revealing sensitive
                                information by impersonating trusted entities. They're the most common attack vector
                                against students, often disguised as messages from the university, financial aid, or
                                popular services.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>What to do:</strong> Always verify before you click. Legitimate organisations
                                rarely ask for sensitive information via email, and urgent or threatening language is a
                                major red flag.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Red Flags to Watch For:</h4>

                                <li>
                                    <strong>Urgency or threats:</strong> "Act now or your account will be suspended!" —
                                    legitimate services rarely use this language
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Suspicious sender addresses:</strong> Check the actual email address, not
                                    just the display name (e.g., "ECU IT" but from randomaddress@gmail.com)
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Generic greetings:</strong> "Dear Student" or "Dear User" instead of your

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Spelling and grammar errors:</strong> Professional organisations proofread
                                    their communications
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Suspicious links:</strong> Hover over links to see the actual URL before
                                    clicking — does it match the claimed sender?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Requests for sensitive information:</strong> Universities and banks never
                                    ask for passwords via email
                                </li>

                            <p>
                                <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Software updates aren't just about new features — they
                                often contain critical security patches that fix known vulnerabilities. Delaying updates
                                leaves your devices exposed to attacks that exploit these weaknesses.

                                <strong>What to do:</strong> Enable automatic updates wherever possible. When you
                                receive an update notification, install it as soon as practical — don't dismiss it
                                repeatedly.

                                    <strong>Web browsers:</strong> Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge — browsers are a
                                    primary target for attacks
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Applications:</strong> Especially Microsoft Office, Adobe products, and any
                                    software that handles sensitive data
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Antivirus/security software:</strong> Only effective if it has the latest
                                    threat definitions
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Mobile apps:</strong> Update apps from the official app store, not from
                                    random links
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Router firmware:</strong> Often forgotten, but your home router needs
                                    updates too
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Best Practices:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Enable automatic updates on all devices</li>
                                <li>Check for updates at least weekly if automatic updates aren't available</li>
                                <li>Restart your devices regularly to complete pending updates</li>
                                <li>Only download software and updates from official sources</li>
                            </ul>
                            <div class="alert alert--info">
                                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Schedule a weekly "update check" — maybe Sunday evening before
                                the new week starts. It only takes a few minutes and can prevent major headaches.

                        <p>Beyond the Core 4, here are additional practices that enhance your digital security:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Lock your devices:</strong> Always lock your laptop, tablet, or phone when
                                stepping away, even briefly
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi:</strong> Coffee shop or airport Wi-Fi? Use a VPN to
                                encrypt your connection
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Back up your data:</strong> Regular backups protect against ransomware and
                                device failure
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Review app permissions:</strong> Does that game really need access to your
                                contacts and location?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Be cautious with USB devices:</strong> Don't plug in unknown USB drives — they
                                can contain malware
                            </li>

                                <strong>Log out of shared computers:</strong> Always log out and clear the browser when
                                using library or lab computers
                            </li>
